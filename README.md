### Notes Editor

I made this script on 2019 (first year learn to code) to automatically edit the notes that I copied from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

It changes the notes from like this, (the result of copying directly from freeCodeCamp)

![before](/images/before.png "before")

to like this, (maximum just 64 characters per line)

![after](/images/after.png "after")


This script can accept and edit more than 1 file.
